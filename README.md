This is a stock trading game built using Vue.js. The user starts with $10,000 and can use the funds to purchase stocks. Upon purchase, the funds are deducted and stocks are added to the portfolio. When 'End Day' is clicked, the prices adjust. Stocks can then be sold (hopefully for a profit ðŸ™‚) or more can be purchased. At any time, the current state of the app can be stored in Firebase by selecting 'Save Day'. The information saved can also be loaded by selected 'Load Day'. 

This app was created as the final project for this VueJS course: https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/
